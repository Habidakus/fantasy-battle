- add cost for turning
- add UI/UX for human player
- detect if, after applying an action, a squad overlaps another squad
- detect if a squad overlaps with another when offering possible moves, and provide some that allow them to un-merge
- Fix the formation manuever so that it never overlaps with a rock
- make it so that any unit that can only pass has a very negative score?
